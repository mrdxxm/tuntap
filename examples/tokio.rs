//! An example that reads and writes the TUN in parallel.
//!
//! This creates an interface, configures the kernel endpoint and sends pings to that endpoint. It
//! prints whatever packets come back (which should include the pong responses).
//!
//! This does essentialy the same as the `pingpoing` example. However, instead of threads, this
//! uses tokio asynchronous event loop to multiplex between the two directions.
//!
//! You really do want better error handling than all these unwraps.
